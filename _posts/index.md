DateTime (DTT) is a Rust library designed for handling dates and times with precision and flexibility. It provides developers with tools for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting date and time data efficiently. As part of the Mini Functions family of libraries, DTT integrates seamlessly with Rust applications, providing a robust solution for date and time management in software development projects.

## Key Features

DateTime (DTT) provides a wide range of functionality for working with date and time data, including:

- **Versatile Parsing and Validation**: The DateTime (DTT) Rust library showcases its versatility through its extensive support for parsing various date and time formats, catering to a wide array of data sources and standards. This capability is crucial for developers working with diverse datasets or integrating with multiple systems, where consistency in date and time formats cannot always be guaranteed. Below, we delve into the specific formats and standards DTT supports, highlighting its adaptability and utility in different programming scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Manipulation and Formatting**: With DTT, manipulating date and time data is straightforward, thanks to its suite of functions designed to accommodate various programming needs. Whether it's adjusting dates, converting time zones, or formatting dates and times for display, DTT offers the flexibility required to handle these tasks efficiently.
- **Serialization and Deserialization**: Leveraging the serde library, DTT allows for easy serialization and deserialization of the DateTime struct to and from various data formats. This feature is particularly useful for applications that need to store or transmit date and time data in a structured and interoperable manner.
- **Time Zone and ISO 8601 Support**: DTT supports the creation of new DateTime objects with either UTC or custom timezone specifications, ensuring that applications can handle date and time data across different geographical locations accurately. Additionally, the library provides robust support for working with ISO 8601 date and time formats, a critical feature for international applications
- **Developer-Friendly Macros**: DTT includes macros for input validation and struct generation, streamlining the development process and ensuring that developers can work with date and time data efficiently.
- **Performance and Reliability**: DTT is designed to be performant and reliable, ensuring that date and time operations are executed with precision and accuracy. The library's robust testing suite and continuous integration pipeline ensure that it meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.

DateTime (DTT) is a powerful and versatile Rust library for managing dates and times, offering a wide range of features and capabilities to meet the needs of modern Rust applications. With its focus on ease of use, flexibility, and robustness, DTT is an essential tool for developers working with date and time data in Rust.
